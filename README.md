# Hello there, I'm Alex Heo
### Front End Web Developer with strong Backend foundations

> Hello, my name is Alex Heo and I create web sites and web applications in React. This skill was learned at a coding bootcamp where I spent 10+ hours a day programming over 12 weeks. There I learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and powerful libraries such as React, as well as backend development with Node, Express, and relational databases like PostgreSQL.

> The years I spent bartending helped me grow as a person, and I got to develop my people skills as well as the ability to multitask and stay cool and focused under high pressure. My love for coding grows everyday the more I learn, and I look forward to working as a developer where I can contribute my skills and knowledge to the ever evolving world of the internet.
